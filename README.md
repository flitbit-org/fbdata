# Flitbit.Data

Exotic data access and object-relational mapping for c#

---
No doubt you've seen or heard what [MSDN - Data Developer Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx) says:

> Entity Framework is Microsoft’s recommended data access technology for new applications

Everything else is therefore _exotic_.

## Work in Progress

The last build put into production is version 1.5. Patches, issue tracking, etc. for that release are still maintained at [unfuddle](https://flitbit.unfuddle.com) [restricted access]. This new version will not be backwards compatible but will be an easy upgrade. This improved version has seen fits and starts over the past few years, including the work earlier this year when I moved it from SVN (unfuddle) to [a public repo on codeplex](https://fbdata.codeplex.com/); I now regard this repository as the project's home.

The develop branch is where incremental work occurs until a 3.x release can be achieved.
